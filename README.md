This is a submission for Shopify's Frontend internship program. 


This app allows the user to: 

    - Create a new login 
    - Login with an existing username to see posts they have liked
    - Query the Nasa API for images of specific galaxies
    - Like a post
    - Unlike a post
    - Log out, and back in with a new user name 


***Disclaimer***

Known issues: 
    - Unliking items does not render properly to reflect liked posts to the JSON server. This is mostly due to the limitations of making relational data with a non-relationa database such as JSON server.
    - There was a time constraint which limited the implementation of styling, but alt tags are provided for each image rendered to on the page.



Enjoy!
